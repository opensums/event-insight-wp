== Background ==

This plugin was created for a sailing club which started to use the ticketing
service [TicketTailor](https://www.tickettailor.com?fp_ref=opensums)
during the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020.  The club wanted to be able to show
who had booked a ticket for an event to the people running it without giving
them access to TicketTailor itself.
