== Background ==

This plugin was created for a sailing club which started to use the ticketing service [TicketTailor](https://www.tickettailor.com?fp_ref=opensums) during the COVID-19 restrictions of 2020.  The club wanted to be able to show who had booked a ticket for an event to the people running it without giving them access to TicketTailor itself.
